            <h3 class="section-header">2. Inspiration</h3>
            <p>
              I have been studying Korean for seven years. After a while, I had
              found a number of resources I liked. However, at a point the
              number of separate resources I was using became burdensome.
            </p>
            <p>
              Initially, I only used a basic online dictionary. Later, I grew
              interested in
              <span
                class="glossary-word"
                title="Traditional Chinese characters, in the context of the Korean language. Although in modern Korean they are only occasionally used, they make up what is analogous to Latin root words in English and find their way into the etymologies of many words. Estimates usually place the percentage of Korean words of Sino-Korean origin above 50%, although these words are also less frequent in usage."
                >Hanja</span
              >
              characters and wanted to study them. Unfortunately, the online
              dictionary's Hanja dictionary is less than ideal, as its example
              words are not listed in order of usage or relevance.
            </p>
            <p>
              To get a resource with a better order, I instead had a separate
              app installed. However, this app did not have a desktop or web
              version, so now I had different resource accessibility on
              different devices.
            </p>
            <p>
              I later began using Anki, a flashcard program, to systematically
              reencounter the same words in the same context repeatedly. Making
              Anki flashcards was tedious, as I had to copy and paste
              information both the online dictionary and the Hanja app for
              almost every card. The flashcard's information also only existed
              in Anki, so if I ever looked at the online dictionary entry again
              for the word, none of my work would be there.
            </p>
            <p>
              I was using the online dictionary and the Hanja app because I
              liked the default wealth of information they provided. But with
              Anki, I liked the ability to make my own cards, with sentences and
              contexts
              <b>I</b> personally found and experienced.
            </p>
            <p>
              NEED TO IMPROVE THIS PART Later, I got a paper French dictionary.
              In the age of technology, a paper dictionary felt impractical. But
              when I looked inside I realized it was exactly what I was looking
              for. The previous owner left examples of a word they had seen for
              themselves in the margins of each line; the original page was just
              a default setting. They could add whatever they wanted.
            </p>
            <p>
              Recreating this experience is the major premise of this Korean
              dictionary. Rather than copy and pasting to Anki, you can add
              notes, pictures, and example sentences directly into the entry for
              any word. You can mark words as 'known' and the dictionary will
              specifically prioritize those words when ordering Hanja words. And
              most importantly, there are no separate flashcards. Here, the
              entire dictionary is now the set of flashcards, and choosing to
              study any word just involves adding the dictionary entry into your
              study list.
            </p>
            <p>
              This is all also user specific, so it is like every user has their
              own "copy" they can personally edit.
            </p>
            <p>
              The dictionary also includes standard dictionary features like
              being able to click on any word to search for its meaning. For a
              complete list of features, view the repository(linkto) for the
              dictionary.
