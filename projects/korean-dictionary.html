            <h3 class="section-header">2. Inspiration and Concept</h3>
            <p>
              I have been studying Korean since 2018. A few years in, I had
              found a number of resources I liked. However, at a point the
              number of separate resources I was using became burdensome.
            </p>
            <p>
              Initially, I only used a basic online dictionary (<span
                class="glossary-word"
                title="De facto standard online Korean dictionary."
                >Naver Dictionary</span
              >). Later, I grew interested in
              <span
                class="glossary-word"
                title="Traditional Chinese characters, in the context of the Korean language. Although in modern Korean they are only occasionally used, they make up what is analogous to Latin root words in English and find their way into the etymologies of many words. Estimates usually place the percentage of Korean words of Sino-Korean origin above 50%, although these words are also less frequent in usage."
                >Hanja</span
              >
              characters and wanted to study them. Unfortunately, the online
              dictionary's Hanja dictionary is less than ideal, as its
              <span
                class="glossary-word"
                title="Korean words that contain a given Hanja character in their etymology."
                >example words</span
              >
              are not listed in order of usage or relevance.
            </p>
            <p>
              To get a resource with a better order, I instead had a separate
              app installed. However, this app did not have a desktop or web
              version, so now I had different resource accessibility on
              different devices.
            </p>
            <p>
              I later began using Anki, a flashcard program, to systematically
              reencounter the same words in the same context repeatedly. Making
              Anki flashcards was tedious, as I had to copy and paste
              information both the online dictionary and the Hanja app for
              almost every card. There are tools to make the process faster, but
              they fail to solve another problem I had: a flashcard's
              information only exists in Anki. If I ever looked at the online
              dictionary entry again for the word, none of my work would be
              there.
            </p>
            <p>
              I was using the online dictionary and the Hanja app because I
              liked the built-in large number of words and information they
              provided. But with Anki, I liked the ability to make my own cards,
              with sentences and contexts
              <b>I</b> personally found and experienced.
            </p>
            <p>
              Later, I looked inside of a paper dictionary and saw that the
              previous owner had left a number of notes for themselves in the
              margins of each page. They wrote example sentences and drew
              pictures right on the page, without the need to copy the
              definition from the dictionary to some other location. And
              whenever they looked that word up again, all of their writings
              would still be there.
            </p>
            <p>
              Recreating this experience in a digital format is the major
              premise of this Korean dictionary. Rather than copy and pasting to
              Anki, you can add notes, pictures, and example sentences directly
              into the entry for any word. You can mark words as 'known' and the
              dictionary will specifically prioritize those words when ordering
              Hanja words. And most importantly, there are no separate
              flashcards. Here, the entire dictionary is now the set of
              flashcards, and choosing to study any word just involves adding
              the dictionary entry into your study list.
            </p>
            <p>
              This is all also user specific, so every user has their own "copy"
              of the dictionary they can personally edit.
            </p>
            <p>
              The dictionary also includes standard dictionary features like
              being able to click on any word to search for its meaning. For a
              complete list of features, view
